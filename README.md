CHR-2 Code taken from Foutz TJ, Arlow RL, McIntyre CC (2012) Theoretical principles underlying optical stimulation of a channelrhodopsin-2 positive pyramidal neuron.


## Instructions for Using this Model
Step 1:
First run the Foutz model at this link [Foutz TJ, Arlow RL, McIntyre CC (2012) Theoretical principles underlying optical stimulation of a channelrhodopsin-2 positive pyramidal neuron] (https://github.com/risecourse/Foutz2012)
In the Foutz model, run OpticalStimulation.py.

Step 2:
Then run the "OpticalStimulationStripped.py" file in this repository.

Step 3:
Run PING_Model1.0.py to access our network of excitatory and inhibitory cells. Run Scaled-Up Composite Rhythm.py to see all the spiking of the 100 neurons in the network on one graph.
