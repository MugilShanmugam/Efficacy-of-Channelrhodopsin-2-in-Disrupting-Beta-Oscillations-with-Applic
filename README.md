# Investigation of Optogenetic Cells and Parkinson's Disease
 This repository contains code regarding our BU RISE Project revolving around Optogenetic Cells and Parkinson's Disease


CHR-2 Code taken from Foutz TJ, Arlow RL, McIntyre CC (2012) Theoretical principles underlying optical stimulation of a channelrhodopsin-2 positive pyramidal neuron


## Instructions for Using this Model

First run the Foutz model at this link [Foutz TJ, Arlow RL, McIntyre CC (2012) Theoretical principles underlying optical stimulation of a channelrhodopsin-2 positive pyramidal neuron] (https://github.com/risecourse/Foutz2012)

Then run the "OpticalStimulationStripped.py" file in this repository.
